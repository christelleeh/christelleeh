## Hi there!
I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science and Business Analytics at IE University in Madrid! 
I have a background in civil engineering and have experience in construction and project management. 
I'm graduating in March 2026. Till then, I'll be working on my coding and analytical skills 😄
